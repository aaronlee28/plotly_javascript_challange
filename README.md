The goal of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 

There are two steps to this project. The first project uses the D3 library to read the data in JSON, and to create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. 

The second part of the project is to create a bubble chart that displays each sample, display the sample metadata, for example, an individualâ€™s demographic information, and lastly, display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page, and lastly, update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected. 

The bonus part of the project is to create a gauge chart using plot.ly to plot the weekly washing frequency of each individual.
